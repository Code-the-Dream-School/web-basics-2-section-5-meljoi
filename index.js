//------------------------ Game Project---------------------------
//Do you remember the game Battleship we created before? well .... it is time to make it with the DOM!!
//We are providing you with the design of a board (in the DOM) for a player1, you have to create the board for the player2 using the id property 'board_player2' -> it is the second list (ul) in your index.html file
//First ask the players for their names (use propmt)
//Now each time the turn player clicks on any cell of the opponent's board (you have to verify if the player is clicking the right board) the program needs to verify if there is an opponent's ship in that cell. If it is then the opponent has one less ship
//We want you to store the data of each player in two Player objects. Each object has to store: name, remaining boats, and their respective board.
//Each board needs to be initialized randomly with '0' and four '1' wich means the state of the cell. Numbers 1 are representing the 4 positions of the player's ships
//Also we want you to display the name of the turn player in the tag that has the id 'turn_player'. And if there is a winner  a text with: 'Congratulationes {name_player}!! you win'
//in the index.html file you are going to find 4 more ids: 'name_player1' , 'name_player2' , 'ships_player1' , 'ships_player2'. We want to see the information of each player in the respective elements
//As our previous Battleship, the winner is the player that hits the 4 opponent's ships first
//one more Thing create a 'reset' and a 'new game' buttons as childs of the element with the id 'buttons'. the reset button has to start the game again and the new game create a new game with new players and a new random board.

JTK

A couple other things - I'm noticing we had both players set to look at count if count % 2 == 0 which means they were both trying to go on even numbered
turns...I changed that so one of them is count % 2 === 1 so now it is even/odd turns

Second

I'm seeing the current player and opponent are undefined when the game begins. I recommend setting the current player and opponent player -
this part of the code, where I'm writing you this comment right now, is a perfectly ok place for it

Last - although there is probably more I don't want to do too much stuff and get in the way of the learning process. You might want to disable
player 2s board from the start

Last but not least - I realized that we weren't undoing the display setting on the other persons board...so like if it was person 1s turn,
we were changing the display settings on person ones board, but we weren't changing them on person two's board and we needed to so I added those
lines immediately under yours... and that's why we were seeing some weird behavior
if you start your game, and assume you are player one and first click on player twos board, you should start seeing the correct board being
disabled.
